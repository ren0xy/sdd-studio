# General
- some skill to ensure when doing raw prompts to modify a spec to ensure structure/itegrity ??

# Tasks 
- option above the markdown "## Tasks" title maybe to handle everything, show all stats 
- add option to view diff (open window)
- only Queued status has hourglass icon in front, Tick/InProgress need an icon!
- StartSubgroup should not be available if its items are in queue (generally the group is)
- some kind of log output as tasks get executed, especially errors ??
    - especially when it trial-errors multiple ways to invoke a console command and figures it out, should log it for future
    - it needs to track better of what it tried and didnt work
    - maybe it needs to ask itself questions/reflect ?
- some metadata json file to track task queue etc ??


- extension UI - some progress bar for each task file whats going on ??
- wow ?? templates are already filled after creating via + so where does one put description ??


- kiro feature: invoking context gather ?? slash commands have it

<instructions>
Distinguish what is in domain of sdd-framework and what is in domain of sdd-studio.
Properly route issues to their domain and create specs there if needed to handle them.
Specs must be independend so they can be implemented standalone, but designed to ensure interfacing/compatibility of outputs.
